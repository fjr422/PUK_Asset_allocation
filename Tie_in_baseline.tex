\subsection{Current Tie-in design}
Best Pensions currently uses a tie-in design, where they initially allocate 80\% of the TDF's value to a Reserve Portfolio, consisting of ZCBs
and 20\% to an Active Portfolio. If the proportion of the overall value allocated to the Active Portfolio at any time
exceeds 23.1 \%, the TDF rebalances the allocation back to 20 \% in the Active Portfolio and 80 \% in the Reserve Portfolio. 
This means that when the Active Portfolio performs well, they use the excess returns to buy more ZCBs, resulting in a 
larger guaranteed value at maturity.
